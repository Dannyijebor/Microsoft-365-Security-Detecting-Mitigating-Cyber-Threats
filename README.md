## **Common Threats & Security Alerts in Microsoft 365**  
The alerts displayed in the image indicate **various types of security threats**, including:

### **1. Privilege Escalation & Unauthorized Access**
- **"A jailbreak attempt on your Azure AI model was detected"**  
  🛑 *Indicates an attempt to bypass security restrictions in AI deployments.*  
- **"Sensitive data exposure by your Azure AI model deployment"**  
  🛑 *Detects exposure of confidential information through AI outputs.*  
- **"Possible prompt injection attack (SGSI smuggling) detected"**  
  🛑 *An adversary attempts to manipulate AI prompts for unintended execution.*  

🔹 *MITIGATION:*  
✔️ **Monitor AI model deployments** for abnormal behavior.  
✔️ **Implement input validation and access controls** to prevent prompt injection attacks.

### **2. Phishing & Social Engineering Attacks**
- **"A user phishing attempt detected in one of your applications"**  
  🛑 *A phishing attack was detected, potentially compromising user credentials.*  
- **"A compromised URL was shared in a malicious email"**  
  🛑 *Users may be receiving phishing emails with malicious links.*  

🔹 *MITIGATION:*  
✔️ Enable **Microsoft Defender for Office 365** to filter phishing emails.  
✔️ Use **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** to prevent credential theft.  
✔️ Educate employees about **phishing awareness** and how to report suspicious emails.

### **3. Unauthorized Access & Data Exfiltration**
- **"A request by a suspicious user agent was sent to your Azure AI resource"**  
  🛑 *Anomalous activity detected from an unrecognized user agent.*  
- **"A suspected wallet attack attempt detected"**  
  🛑 *Potential cryptocurrency wallet breach attempt.*  

🔹 *MITIGATION:*  
✔️ Regularly review **Azure Active Directory (AAD) sign-in logs**.  
✔️ Set up **Conditional Access Policies** to restrict access based on device, location, and risk level.  
✔️ Monitor logs for **failed login attempts and unusual activity**.
